# CreatePlanet-Gimp
A Gimp Plug-in to easily create Planet Sprites for the game Endless Sky. [Demo (v1.3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeUZoXnfJmU)

# Installation
CreatePlanet-Gimp needs to be installed in GIMP's plug-in directory. This differs between versions and platforms, so it's best to find it yourself in the settings. Open GIMP, go to Edit -> Preferences -> Folders -> Plug-ins and choose one of the directories listed there. Now just drop the .py files in that directory and restart GIMP. 
Alternatively, you can clone/download this repository and add it as a new plug-in directory in the aformentioned settings.
